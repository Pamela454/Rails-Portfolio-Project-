# Contributing

## Quick guide:

1. Fork the repo.
2. Run the tests. We only take pull requests with passing tests, and it's great to know that you have a clean slate: `bundle && rake`
3. Add a test for your change. Only styling, documentation and refactoring changes don't require any new tests. If you are adding functionality or fixing a bug, we need a test!
4. Make the test pass.
5. Commit, with a meaningul describing message. This is very important!
6. Push to your fork and submit a pull request.
7. Wait for comments or feedback.
