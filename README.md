    The PatientQuestionWebsite allows either a patient or physician to register as a user. As a patient, the user can submit a question regarding their health to physician users. The question is associated with a body systems category and whether this is a new or existing condition. The physician can register as a user and respond to questions where they feel like they have some expertise. Physicians can view questions sorted by whether it is a new or preexisting condition as well as which questions are unanswered. Both users can edit and delete their communications and edit their profiles. Both user types can also create a profile using their facebook login.
